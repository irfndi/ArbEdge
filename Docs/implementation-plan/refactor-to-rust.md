# Implementation Plan: Refactor to Rust

## Background and Motivation

We want to rewrite the entire ArbEdge codebase in Rust to leverage Rust's performance, memory safety, and strong type guarantees. The application will continue to run on Cloudflare Workers using the Workers database (KV or Durable Objects) and maintain integrations with exchange APIs and the Telegram bot, preserving existing cloud infrastructure and workflows.

## Branch Name

`feature/refactor-to-rust`

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Cloudflare Workers Rust Support:** Compiling Rust to WASM with `wrangler` and ensuring compatibility.
- **Workers Database Integration:** Choosing between KV and Durable Objects and using Rust crates (`workers-rs` or `cloudflare`).
- **Exchange API Clients:** Selecting or building Rust bindings for exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, CCXT-like functionality).
- **Telegram Bot Integration:** Using a Rust crate (e.g., `teloxide`) to interface with the Telegram Bot API.
- **Async and Event-Driven Logic:** Mapping TypeScript async patterns and event handlers (webhook, scheduled) to Rust `async`/`await` and Futures.
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests (`cargo test`), integration tests with HTTP mocks, and ensuring coverage.
- **CI/CD Workflow:** Integrating Rust build and tests into GitHub Actions and `wrangler` deployments.

4. **Implement utility modules in Rust.**
   - Migrate `formatter`, `logger`, and `CustomError` logic.
   - Success Criteria: Unit tests pass for utilities.
5. **Develop exchange API client in Rust.**
   - Implement core exchange methods (e.g., fetch ticker, open positions).
   - Success Criteria: Exchange API client unit tests pass with mocks.
6. **Develop Telegram bot client in Rust.**
   - Integrate with the Telegram Bot API.
   - Success Criteria: Ability to send messages in a mocked environment.
7. **Migrate core business logic.**
   - Rewrite `opportunityService` and `positionsManager` in Rust.
   - Success Criteria: Business logic unit tests cover core functionality.
8. **Rewrite Worker entrypoints.**
   - Implement webhook and scheduled handlers in Rust.
   - Success Criteria: Handlers respond correctly in integration tests.
9. **Write end-to-end tests.**
   - Simulate full workflows (webhook, scheduled) with HTTP mocks.
   - Success Criteria: All end-to-end scenarios pass.
10. **Setup CI pipeline.**
    - Configure GitHub Actions to build, test, and lint the Rust project and deploy via `wrangler`.
    - Success Criteria: CI passes on pull requests.
11. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers.**
    - Use `wrangler publish` for Rust Workers.
    - Success Criteria: Deployment succeeds and endpoints are live.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- ✅ RESOLVED: Build for wasm32-unknown-unknown was failing due to Homebrew Rust taking precedence. Fixed by setting `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` to prioritize rustup-managed toolchain.
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 2 - Successfully set up Rust workspace with worker-build, updated to latest worker crate (0.5.0), and verified deployment dry-run succeeds. Basic KV operations are working.
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 3 - Workers database integration complete with KV operations working in ExchangeService for credential storage.
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 4 - All utility modules migrated: error handling (ArbitrageError), formatter, logger, helpers, and calculations.
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 5 - Exchange API client fully implemented with CCXT-like interface. Features include:
  - HTTP client with authentication (HMAC-SHA256 for Binance/Bybit)
  - Market data fetching (markets, tickers, orderbooks, funding rates)
  - Credential management with KV storage
  - Comprehensive type system for orders, positions, and trading data
  - API endpoints for testing: /exchange/markets, /exchange/ticker, /exchange/funding
  - Successfully replaced CCXT dependency with native Rust implementation
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 6 - Telegram bot client fully implemented with:
  - Message sending with MarkdownV2 formatting
  - Webhook handling for bot commands
  - Opportunity notification system
  - Error handling and rate limiting
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 7 - Core business logic migrated to Rust:
  - OpportunityService for finding funding rate arbitrage opportunities
  - PositionsService for managing trading positions with KV storage
  - Complete async/concurrent opportunity detection
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 8 - Worker entrypoints rewritten in Rust:
  - HTTP handlers for all API endpoints (/health, /exchange/*, /positions/*, /find-opportunities, /webhook)
  - Scheduled handler for automated opportunity monitoring
  - Complete request/response handling with proper error management
- ✅ COMPLETED: Task 9 - End-to-end tests implemented:

## Lessons Learned

- [2025-01-22] CCXT replacement strategy: Since there's no direct CCXT equivalent for Rust, we built our own exchange client using reqwest HTTP client with exchange-specific authentication and API parsing. This provides better control and performance.
- [2025-01-22] Type system design: Used both enum (ExchangeIdEnum) and string alias (ExchangeId) types to maintain compatibility while providing type safety.
- [2025-01-22] Error handling: Implemented comprehensive error system with ArbitrageError that includes context, status codes, and conversion traits for seamless error propagation.
- [2025-01-22] Async closure compilation: Encountered compiler bug with nightly Rust when using Box::pin with explicit type annotations in async closures. Fixed by switching to stable Rust toolchain and simplifying async task collection.
- [2025-01-22] WASM target management: Homebrew Rust installation doesn't include WASM targets by default. Must use rustup-managed toolchain with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` for Cloudflare Workers deployment.
- [2025-01-22] Test environment isolation: Some tests fail in WASM environment due to missing browser APIs. Used conditional compilation (#[cfg(test)]) to provide alternative implementations for test environments.
