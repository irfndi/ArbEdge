Product Requirements Document: Automated Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Bot
Version: 1.1
Date: May 6, 2025
Status: Draft

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for an automated cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. The primary goal is to identify, evaluate, and execute low-risk arbitrage opportunities, initially focusing on funding rate differentials across specified cryptocurrency exchanges for user-configurable trading pairs. The bot aims to provide automated trading capabilities with robust risk management features and a user-friendly control interface via Telegram, designed for deployment on Cloudflare Workers.

1.2 Product Vision
To develop a reliable, efficient, and scalable arbitrage bot that empowers users to capitalize on market inefficiencies across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges for a wide range of assets, minimizing risk through automated hedging and configurable controls, while providing transparency and interaction via a Telegram interface, all running within the Cloudflare edge network.

1.3 Scope
The initial release (MVP) will focus on funding rate arbitrage between Bybit and Binance for user-configurable trading pairs (e.g., starting with a default set like BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, but allowing user modification). It will include core features for API management, opportunity detection, manual trade execution via Telegram, basic position monitoring, and essential risk controls. The system will be architected for deployment on Cloudflare Workers. Future versions will expand to include more exchanges (MEXC), additional arbitrage strategies (e.g., spot-futures), automated trading modes, and advanced analytics.

1.4 Target Audience
Sophisticated retail traders looking to automate arbitrage strategies.

Small quantitative trading firms seeking efficient tools for cross-exchange arbitrage.

Users comfortable with managing API keys, understanding the risks of derivatives trading, and potentially interacting with serverless deployment concepts.

1.5 Glossary
Arbitrage: Simultaneously buying and selling an asset on different markets to profit from a price difference.

Funding Rate Arbitrage: Exploiting differences in funding rates between perpetual contracts on different exchanges by holding opposing positions (long/short).

Perpetual Contract: A type of futures contract with no expiration date.

Funding Rate: Periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual contracts, designed to keep the contract price close to the underlying spot price.

API: Application Programming Interface. Allows software applications to communicate.

Hedging: Taking an offsetting position in a related security to reduce risk.

Margin: The collateral required to open and maintain a leveraged position.

Leverage: Using borrowed funds to increase potential returns (and risks).

TP/SL: Take-Profit / Stop-Loss orders.

MVP: Minimum Viable Product.

Cloudflare Workers: A serverless execution environment that allows running JavaScript, Rust, C, and C++ on Cloudflare's edge network.

Workers KV: Cloudflare's global, low-latency key-value data store.

Durable Objects: Cloudflare's technology providing strongly consistent storage and coordination capabilities at the edge.

2. Goals and Objectives
Automate Arbitrage: Develop a system capable of automatically detecting and (optionally) executing funding rate arbitrage opportunities across configurable pairs.

Minimize Risk: Implement robust risk management features, including configurable margin limits, leverage controls, automated stop-losses, and hedged positions.

User Control: Provide users with control over bot operations, risk parameters, trading pairs, and trade execution via a secure Telegram interface.

Transparency: Offer real-time monitoring, notifications, and performance reporting.

Scalability: Build a modular architecture suitable for the Cloudflare Workers environment, allowing for easy addition of new exchanges, trading pairs, and arbitrage strategies.

Reliability: Ensure stable operation within the Workers environment, handling API errors, network issues, and state management effectively.

Edge Deployment: Leverage Cloudflare Workers for potentially lower latency execution and reduced infrastructure management overhead.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Exchange Integration & API Management
FR1.1: The system must securely connect to exchange APIs (Binance, Bybit initially; MEXC planned).

FR1.2: Users must be able to add, store (encrypted, potentially using Worker secrets or KV), and remove API keys via a configuration file or secure interface/command.

FR1.3: The system must handle exchange-specific API protocols, authentication methods (e.g., HMAC SHA256), and data formats.

FR1.4: The system must respect exchange API rate limits, implementing appropriate throttling and retry logic suitable for the Workers environment.

FR1.5: The system must gracefully handle API errors, connection issues, and exchange maintenance periods, logging relevant events (potentially to an external logging service or Workers KV).

FR1.6: Support for fetching necessary data via REST APIs (WebSockets might require specific Worker patterns or be less suitable for continuous streams):

Funding rates (current and historical)

Ticker prices (spot, perpetual mark price, index price)

Order book data (for slippage estimation - future)

Account balance and margin information

Open positions

Trade history

All listed market details from each connected exchange (e.g., symbol, base asset, quote asset, contract type, minimum order size, volume)

FR1.6.Y: The system must allow configuration of filters for dynamic pair discovery (e.g., include only pairs quoted in USDT, exclude leveraged tokens, minimum 24h volume).

FR1.7: The system must fetch and process market data for dynamically discovered pairs, including but not limited to:

Symbol

Base asset

Quote asset

Contract type

Minimum order size

Volume

FR1.8: The system must apply filters to dynamically discovered pairs based on user-configurable criteria (e.g., quote currency, minimum liquidity/volume).

4.2 Arbitrage Opportunity Detection
FR2.1: The system must fetch and compare funding rates for *dynamically discovered and filtered* trading pairs across connected exchanges at regular intervals (using scheduled Workers or similar triggers).

FR2.2: An arbitrage opportunity is identified when the absolute difference (or normalized difference) between funding rates on two exchanges for a specific pair exceeds a user-configurable threshold (e.g., abs(Rate_A - Rate_B) > X%).

FR2.3: The system should calculate the potential estimated profit for an opportunity, considering:

Funding rate difference

Estimated funding payment frequency (e.g., every 8 hours)

Estimated trading fees (maker/taker) for entry and exit

Estimated slippage (basic implementation initially, more advanced later)

FR2.4: (Post-MVP) Implement detection logic for spot-futures arbitrage (basis trading).

FR2.5: (Post-MVP) Implement detection logic for triangular arbitrage.

FR2.6: Users must be able to configure the list of trading pairs to monitor.

4.3 Trade Execution & Position Management
FR3.1: The system must support two modes:

Manual Mode (MVP): Notify user of opportunities via Telegram; execute trades only upon user command.

Automated Mode (Post-MVP): Automatically execute trades for detected opportunities meeting predefined criteria.

FR3.2: When executing a funding rate arbitrage trade, the system must simultaneously place (or attempt to place near-simultaneously):

A long perpetual contract order on the exchange with the lower funding rate.

A short perpetual contract order on the exchange with the higher funding rate.

Order sizes should be matched to ensure market neutrality (delta-neutral).

FR3.3: Users must be able to configure trade parameters via Telegram (for manual mode) or configuration:

Maximum total margin allocation for the bot.

Margin allocation per trade (as % of max allocation or fixed amount).

Leverage per position (within exchange limits).

FR3.4: The system must support placing limit orders to control entry price and minimize slippage. (Market orders as fallback if needed).

Entry price

Current mark price

Unrealized P&L

Margin usage

Funding payments received/paid

FR3.6: The system must support closing positions:

Manually via Telegram command.

(Post-MVP) Automatically based on triggers (TP, SL, funding rate convergence, time limit).

4.4 Risk Management
FR4.1: Pre-trade Checks: Before executing any trade, the system must verify:

Sufficient available margin on both exchanges for the intended positions and leverage (requires fetching current balances).

Total allocated margin does not exceed the user-defined maximum.

Calculated liquidation prices are within acceptable bounds relative to current price volatility (basic check).

FR4.2: Hedging: Ensure all arbitrage trades are hedged (equal and opposite positions) to minimize directional market risk.

FR4.3: (Post-MVP) Automated Stop-Loss (SL): Automatically place SL orders upon position entry or allow configuration.

FR4.4: (Post-MVP) Automated Take-Profit (TP): Automatically place TP orders upon position entry or allow configuration.

/remove_pair <PAIR>: Remove a trading pair from the monitoring list.

/list_pairs: Show the currently monitored trading pairs.

/help: Display available commands.

FR5.4: Notifications (MVP):

Alert when a new arbitrage opportunity meeting criteria is detected (in manual mode).

Confirmation of successful trade execution (entry/exit price, size, fees).

Notification upon manual or automated position closure.

Error notifications (e.g., failed trade execution, API issues).

FR5.5: (Post-MVP) Advanced Commands: Setting TP/SL, enabling/disabling auto-trade, configuring thresholds.

FR5.6: (Post-MVP) Reporting Commands: /report daily, /report weekly for performance summaries.

4.6 Logging and Reporting
FR6.1: The system must log all significant events. Given Worker limitations, logging might target:

Workers KV: For essential operational logs (limited size/frequency).

External Logging Service: (Recommended) Send logs via fetch to services like Cloudflare Logpush, Datadog, Sentry, etc.

FR6.2: Logs should be timestamped and structured (e.g., JSON).

FR6.3: (Post-MVP) Generate basic performance reports (e.g., total P&L over a period) accessible via Telegram, potentially aggregating data stored in KV or an external store.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance
NFR1.1: Latency: Opportunity detection and order placement should minimize delay within the constraints of the Workers execution model (scheduled triggers, API call times). Target < 10-15 seconds from trigger to order submission. WebSocket usage for real-time data might be challenging and require Durable Objects or alternative patterns.

NFR1.2: Concurrency: Cloudflare Workers handle concurrency automatically, but individual worker execution time limits must be respected. Complex analysis might need to be broken down or optimized.

5.2 Reliability
NFR2.1: Uptime: Relies on Cloudflare's infrastructure uptime. Application logic must be robust.

NFR2.2: Fault Tolerance: The system must handle API errors and network issues gracefully. State management (using KV/Durable Objects) is crucial for recovering state between potentially short-lived Worker executions.

NFR2.3: Data Integrity: Ensure accuracy in calculations and consistency in position tracking, especially when dealing with distributed state (KV).

5.3 Security
NFR3.1: API Key Security: Use Cloudflare Worker secrets for storing sensitive API keys. Avoid storing them directly in code or less secure KV entries.

NFR3.2: Secure Communication: All communication with external APIs must use HTTPS.

NFR3.3: Telegram Security: Use secrets for bot tokens. Validate incoming Telegram webhooks. Implement user authorization checks.

NFR3.4: Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all user inputs (via Telegram) and API responses.

5.4 Scalability
NFR4.1: Exchange Scalability: Architecture should allow adding new exchange integrations.

NFR4.2: Strategy Scalability: System design should facilitate incorporating new arbitrage strategies.

NFR4.3: Load Scalability: Cloudflare Workers provide automatic scaling, but application design must be efficient to stay within execution limits.

5.5 Usability
NFR5.1: Telegram Interface: Commands should be intuitive, notifications clear.

NFR5.2: Configuration: Setup (API keys, pairs, margin) should be manageable via Telegram commands or a simple configuration mechanism compatible with Workers deployment.

5.6 Maintainability
NFR6.1: Code Quality & Testing: Development must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Code (likely TypeScript) should be well-documented, adhere to established best practices, and maintain a test coverage of >95% (verified using tools like Codecov). Comprehensive unit and integration tests are required, adapted where necessary for the Cloudflare Workers environment.

NFR6.2: Modularity: Components should be logically separated.

NFR6.3: Continuous Integration (CI): A CI pipeline must be implemented (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically build, lint, and run tests on every commit to the main branches. Deployment to Cloudflare Workers should be integrated into this pipeline.
NFR6.4: Test Coverage: Automated tests must achieve a minimum of 95% code coverage, tracked using a tool like Codecov. Coverage reports should be generated as part of the CI process.

6. Technical Specifications
Backend Language: TypeScript (Strongly Preferred) due to native Cloudflare Workers support and robust ecosystem. Python (via Pyodide/Wasm) is a possibility but adds complexity and potential limitations.

Key Libraries/Frameworks:

Exchange Interaction: ccxt (JavaScript version) or individual exchange API clients compatible with the Fetch API available in Workers.

Telegram Bot: Libraries suitable for webhook-based interaction within Workers (e.g., using itty-router for routing and direct Telegram API calls via fetch, or specific lightweight bot frameworks).

Async Operations: Native async/await in TypeScript/JavaScript.

Deployment: Cloudflare Workers. Configuration via wrangler.toml and potentially Workers KV for dynamic settings.

Scheduling: Cloudflare Cron Triggers for periodic tasks like fetching funding rates.

State Management:

Cloudflare Workers KV: For storing configuration, user settings, potentially simple position state (consider read/write limits and consistency model).

Cloudflare Durable Objects: (Recommended for complex state) For managing individual position states, ensuring consistency, and potentially handling WebSocket connections if needed.

Data Storage:

Configuration: Worker secrets, wrangler.toml, Workers KV.

Logs: External logging service (preferred) or Workers KV (limited).

State: Workers KV or Durable Objects.
