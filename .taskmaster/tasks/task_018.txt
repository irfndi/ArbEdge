# Task ID: 18
# Title: Data Synchronization Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement eventually consistent synchronization, conflict resolution for concurrent updates, diff-based sync for efficiency, and manual sync triggers for operators
# Details:
Build sync coordinator service with write-through, write-behind, read-repair, and periodic reconciliation strategies. Include conflict resolution engine, diff calculation algorithms, and manual sync tools for operational control.

# Test Strategy:
Sync completes in <5 seconds after recovery, conflicts resolved correctly, diff-based sync is efficient, manual triggers work

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Sync Coordinator Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational sync coordinator service with write-through, write-behind, read-repair, and periodic reconciliation strategies
### Details:
Build the core sync coordinator that orchestrates data synchronization between KV, D1, and R2 storage systems. Implement multiple sync strategies: write-through (immediate sync), write-behind (async batched sync), read-repair (fix inconsistencies on read), and periodic reconciliation (scheduled consistency checks). Include configurable sync policies, retry mechanisms, and performance monitoring. Ensure integration with circuit breaker and health monitoring systems.

## 2. Vector Clock Conflict Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement vector clock-based conflict detection and resolution for concurrent updates across distributed storage systems
### Details:
Build a comprehensive conflict detection system using vector clocks to track causal relationships between operations. Implement automatic conflict resolution for concurrent updates using strategies like Last-Write-Wins with timestamps, semantic merging for compatible changes, and user-defined resolution rules. Include conflict notification system, resolution audit trails, and configurable conflict resolution policies per data type.

## 3. Diff-based Sync Engine [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build efficient diff calculation algorithms and delta synchronization for minimizing data transfer overhead
### Details:
Implement high-performance diff calculation engine supporting multiple data types (JSON, binary, structured data). Build delta sync protocols that only transfer changes rather than full states. Include compression algorithms for diff payloads, merkle trees for efficient change detection, and rolling hash algorithms for large dataset synchronization. Optimize for both network efficiency and computational performance.

## 4. Manual Sync Controls & Operator Tools [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive manual sync triggers, operator dashboards, and administrative controls for sync management
### Details:
Build operator-friendly tools for manual sync control including force sync triggers, selective sync by data type/range, sync status monitoring dashboards, and emergency sync controls. Implement sync scheduling, sync queue management, batch operation tools, and detailed sync reporting. Include REST APIs for integration with monitoring systems and administrative tooling.

## 5. Sync Integration Testing & Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive integration testing for sync operations across all storage systems with consistency validation
### Details:
Build extensive integration test suite covering concurrent sync operations, network partition scenarios, partial sync failures, conflict resolution testing, performance validation under load, and consistency verification across all storage backends. Include chaos testing for sync resilience, automated consistency checks, and performance benchmarking. Validate zero data loss during sync operations and proper recovery from failures.
