# Task ID: 21
# Title: Legacy System Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Maintain compatibility with existing services, implement gradual migration strategies, add feature flags for rollback capability, and create data validation for migrations
# Details:
Implement dual-write strategy for writing to both old and new systems, gradual read migration to shift reads incrementally, validation to compare results between systems, and rollback procedures for quick revert if issues arise.

# Test Strategy:
No service disruption during migration, data consistency between old and new systems, rollback works quickly, feature flags function properly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Legacy System Migration Controller [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive migration controller that orchestrates dual-write strategies, gradual migration phases, and rollback capabilities with comprehensive feature flags
### Details:
Implement MigrationController with dual-write coordinator, gradual migration phases, feature flag integration, validation framework, and rollback mechanisms. Must support zero-downtime migrations with circuit breaker patterns and comprehensive monitoring.

## 2. Data Validation & Consistency Engine [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive data validation engine that compares results between old and new systems, validates data integrity, and ensures consistency during migration phases
### Details:
Create ValidationEngine with data comparison algorithms, consistency checks, integrity validation, performance monitoring, and automated reporting. Must integrate with monitoring system and provide real-time validation metrics.

## 3. Feature Flag Migration Manager [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance feature flag system with migration-specific flags, percentage-based rollouts, and automated migration progression with safety controls
### Details:
Extend feature_flags.json with legacy_system_integration section, implement MigrationFeatureManager with percentage rollouts, gradual enablement, safety thresholds, and automated progression/rollback logic.

## 4. Dual-Write Coordination System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement high-performance dual-write system that writes to both legacy and new systems with transaction coordination, error handling, and performance optimization
### Details:
Create DualWriteCoordinator with transaction management, parallel writes, consistency guarantees, error recovery, performance monitoring, and integration with existing TransactionCoordinator from persistence layer.

## 5. Gradual Read Migration System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement intelligent read migration system that gradually shifts read operations from legacy to new systems based on performance metrics and validation results
### Details:
Create ReadMigrationManager with intelligent routing, performance monitoring, fallback mechanisms, canary deployments, and integration with circuit breaker service for automatic failover.

## 6. Legacy Integration Adapter Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create adapter layer that provides seamless integration between legacy components and new modular architecture, ensuring backward compatibility and smooth transition
### Details:
Implement AdapterLayer with legacy API compatibility, service mapping, request/response translation, error handling, and integration points for existing services like TelegramService, OpportunityEngine, and AnalyticsEngine.
