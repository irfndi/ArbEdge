User Management API (src/handlers/user_management.rs):**\n- ✅ ALREADY PRODUCTION-READY: Uses real UserProfileService with database queries\n- ✅ Real authentication, profile fetching, updates, preferences\n- ✅ No mock data found\n\n**2. Health Check API (src/handlers/health.rs):**\n- ✅ ALREADY PRODUCTION-READY: Tests real KV/D1/services connectivity\n- ✅ Uses actual health checks with timestamps and service validation\n- ✅ No mock data found\n\n**3. Trading API (src/handlers/trading.rs):**\n- ❌ FIXED: Replaced \"Trading module placeholder\" with production implementation\n- ✅ Now uses real UserProfileService to fetch trading balance, risk profile, settings\n- ✅ Authentication required, real database queries, comprehensive balance data\n\n**4. AI API (src/handlers/ai.rs):**\n- ❌ FIXED: Replaced \"AI module placeholder\" with production implementation  \n- ✅ Now uses real AiAnalysisService with subscription verification\n- ✅ Authentication + premium subscription check, real market analysis\n\n**5. Analytics API (src/handlers/analytics.rs):**\n- ❌ FIXED: Replaced \"Analytics module placeholder\" with production implementation\n- ✅ Now uses real AnalyticsService for comprehensive dashboard data\n- ✅ Authentication required, real user analytics, performance metrics\n\n**6. Admin API (src/handlers/admin.rs):**\n- ❌ FIXED: Replaced all placeholder/TODO implementations with production code\n- ✅ Real admin permission verification (admin/super_admin access levels)\n- ✅ Real AdminService integration for user stats, system info, config management\n- ✅ Proper authentication, authorization, and error handling\n\n**ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:**\n✅ Modularization: Each handler properly separated with clear responsibilities\n✅ Zero Duplication: Common service initialization patterns, no repeated code\n✅ No Circular Dependencies: Clean imports and service dependencies\n✅ High Efficiency: Concurrent service initialization, proper error handling\n✅ High Reliability: Comprehensive error handling, authentication checks\n✅ Feature Flags: Integrated where applicable (subscription features, admin access)\n✅ No Mock Implementation: All placeholder code replaced with real service calls\n\n**RESULT:** All API endpoints now use production-ready implementations with real data sources, proper authentication, and comprehensive error handling. Zero mock/placeholder data remaining.\n</info added on 2025-06-13T17:20:23.067Z>",
