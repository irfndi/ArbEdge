# Task ID: 19
# Title: Automated Cleanup System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement TTL-based automatic cleanup, manual cleanup policies for operators, storage usage monitoring, and cleanup impact analysis
# Details:
Create cleanup scheduler service with TTL-based, usage-based, size-based, and manual cleanup policies. Include policy management interface, storage analytics dashboard, and cleanup impact tools for safe operations.

# Test Strategy:
Cleanup efficiency >90%, storage growth <10%/month, policies execute correctly, impact analysis prevents data loss

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Cleanup Scheduler Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational cleanup scheduler service with TTL-based, usage-based, size-based, and manual cleanup policies
### Details:
Build the core cleanup scheduler that orchestrates automated data cleanup across KV, D1, and R2 storage systems. Implement multiple cleanup strategies: TTL-based (time-based expiration), usage-based (last accessed date), size-based (storage quotas), and manual triggers. Include configurable cleanup policies, retry mechanisms, safety checks, and performance monitoring. Ensure integration with existing storage systems and circuit breaker patterns.

## 2. Storage Usage Analytics & Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive storage analytics dashboard with usage tracking, growth predictions, and real-time monitoring
### Details:
Build storage analytics system that tracks usage patterns across all storage types (KV, D1, R2). Implement real-time monitoring of storage consumption, access patterns, data age distribution, and cost analytics. Include predictive analytics for storage growth, trend analysis, capacity planning, and automated alerting for unusual patterns. Create visualization dashboard for operators with drill-down capabilities and historical reporting.

## 3. Cleanup Impact Analysis Engine [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build comprehensive cleanup impact analysis system to prevent data loss and ensure safe cleanup operations
### Details:
Implement sophisticated impact analysis engine that analyzes potential consequences before cleanup operations. Include dependency tracking, reference validation, data lineage analysis, and risk assessment. Build safety mechanisms like dry-run mode, rollback capabilities, and staged cleanup execution. Include integration with existing monitoring systems and automated safety checks to prevent accidental deletion of critical data.

## 4. Cleanup Policy Management Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create operator-friendly policy management interface for configuring, testing, and managing cleanup policies
### Details:
Build comprehensive policy management system that allows operators to configure TTL policies, usage-based cleanup rules, size quotas, and custom cleanup strategies. Include policy validation, testing framework, policy versioning, and rollback capabilities. Provide REST APIs for integration with other systems, bulk policy operations, and policy templates for common use cases. Include audit logging and compliance reporting.

## 5. Cleanup Integration Testing & Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive integration testing for cleanup operations with safety validation and performance benchmarking
### Details:
Build extensive integration test suite covering all cleanup scenarios, safety mechanisms, policy enforcement, and performance validation. Include load testing for concurrent cleanup operations, chaos testing for failure scenarios, compliance testing for data retention policies, and automated safety validation. Validate cleanup efficiency metrics, storage optimization results, and ensure zero data loss during normal operations.
