# Task ID: 14
# Title: Enhanced KV Cache System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement hierarchical caching with multiple TTL tiers, compression for large objects (>1KB), cache warming strategies, and metadata tracking for cleanup
# Details:
Create KvCacheManager with tier management, compression middleware, cache warming service, and metadata tracking system. Support different TTL tiers for different data types and automatic compression for objects larger than 1KB.

# Test Strategy:
Cache hit ratio >95%, response time <50ms, compression works for large objects, metadata tracking functional

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design KV Cache Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the hierarchical cache architecture with multiple TTL tiers, data type categorization, and tier management strategies
### Details:
Define cache tier structure (hot/warm/cold), TTL policies per data type, eviction strategies, and tier promotion/demotion logic

## 2. Implement Core KvCacheManager [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create the core KvCacheManager struct with basic get/set operations and tier management
### Details:
Implement the main cache manager with tier routing, basic operations, error handling, and configuration management

## 3. Add Compression Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement automatic compression for objects larger than 1KB with configurable compression algorithms
### Details:
Add compression layer using gzip/brotli for large objects, automatic detection of compression benefit, and transparent decompression

## 4. Implement Cache Warming Service [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Create cache warming strategies for preloading frequently accessed data and predictive caching
### Details:
Build cache warming service with usage pattern analysis, predictive preloading, scheduled warming, and warming priority management

## 5. Add Metadata Tracking System [done]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Implement metadata tracking for cache analytics, cleanup optimization, and performance monitoring
### Details:
Create metadata system tracking access patterns, size metrics, TTL effectiveness, compression ratios, and cleanup eligibility

## 6. Integration Testing & Performance Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Test the complete KV cache system and validate performance targets are met
### Details:
Run comprehensive tests for cache hit ratio >95%, response time <50ms, compression effectiveness, and metadata accuracy
