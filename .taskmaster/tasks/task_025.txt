# Task ID: 25
# Title: Comprehensive Command Data Integrity Audit
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Audit each Telegram, Discord, and API command to ensure all outputs use real production data (no mock/placeholder) and meet user expectations.
# Details:
1. Enumerate every command across Telegram, Discord, and API interfaces.
2. For each command, trace through handlers, services, and data sources to confirm real data usage.
3. Identify any residual mock data, placeholders, or stub implementations; replace with production-ready logic.
4. Validate command output fields, formatting, and UX against requirements (e.g., confidence score, P/L %, timestamps, etc.).
5. Write extensive tests that simulate real data flows and verify correct command responses.
6. Document findings and create follow-up subtasks for any issues beyond scope.
7. Ensure zero warnings/unused code leftover after fixes and that CI passes.

### Description: Create comprehensive inventory of every command in Telegram, Discord, and API interfaces
### Details:
1. Scan src/services/interfaces/telegram/commands/ for all Telegram commands\n2. Scan src/services/interfaces/discord/ for Discord commands\n3. Scan src/services/interfaces/api/ for API endpoints\n4. Document command names, handlers, and expected functionality\n5. Create mapping of command → handler → service dependencies\n6. Identify high-priority commands that users interact with most

## 2. Audit Telegram Commands Data Sources [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Trace each Telegram command to verify real data usage and eliminate mock/placeholder implementations
### Details:
1. For each Telegram command, trace data flow from handler to service to data source\n2. Identify any mock data, hardcoded values, or placeholder responses\n3. Verify commands use live APIs (Binance, OKX, etc.) and real database queries\n4. Check opportunity listings use new deduplication and funding rate integration\n5. Validate user profile data comes from real database persistence\n6. Document findings and create fix list

## 3. Audit Discord Commands Data Sources [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Verify Discord interface uses real production data and eliminate any mock implementations
### Details:
1. Trace Discord command handlers to their data sources\n2. Verify integration with real services (not mocks)\n3. Check Discord opportunity notifications use live data\n4. Validate user authentication and profile management\n5. Ensure Discord commands respect feature flags\n6. Document any issues found

## 4. Audit API Endpoints Data Sources [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Verify all API endpoints return real production data with proper formatting and validation
### Details:
1. Test each API endpoint in src/services/interfaces/api/\n2. Verify responses contain real data (not mock/placeholder)\n3. Check opportunity API endpoints use new deduplication system\n4. Validate user management APIs use real database operations\n5. Ensure proper error handling and status codes\n6. Verify API responses match expected schema/format

✅ COMPLETED API Endpoints Audit (25.4)

**FINDINGS & FIXES:**

**1. User Management API (src/handlers/user_management.rs):**
- ✅ ALREADY PRODUCTION-READY: Uses real UserProfileService with database queries
- ✅ Real authentication, profile fetching, updates, preferences
- ✅ No mock data found

**2. Health Check API (src/handlers/health.rs):**
- ✅ ALREADY PRODUCTION-READY: Tests real KV/D1/services connectivity
- ✅ Uses actual health checks with timestamps and service validation
- ✅ No mock data found

**3. Trading API (src/handlers/trading.rs):**
- ❌ FIXED: Replaced "Trading module placeholder" with production implementation
- ✅ Now uses real UserProfileService to fetch trading balance, risk profile, settings
- ✅ Authentication required, real database queries, comprehensive balance data

**4. AI API (src/handlers/ai.rs):**
- ❌ FIXED: Replaced "AI module placeholder" with production implementation  
- ✅ Now uses real AiAnalysisService with subscription verification
- ✅ Authentication + premium subscription check, real market analysis

**5. Analytics API (src/handlers/analytics.rs):**
- ❌ FIXED: Replaced "Analytics module placeholder" with production implementation
- ✅ Now uses real AnalyticsService for comprehensive dashboard data
- ✅ Authentication required, real user analytics, performance metrics

**6. Admin API (src/handlers/admin.rs):**
- ❌ FIXED: Replaced all placeholder/TODO implementations with production code
- ✅ Real admin permission verification (admin/super_admin access levels)
- ✅ Real AdminService integration for user stats, system info, config management
- ✅ Proper authentication, authorization, and error handling

**ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:**
✅ Modularization: Each handler properly separated with clear responsibilities
✅ Zero Duplication: Common service initialization patterns, no repeated code
✅ No Circular Dependencies: Clean imports and service dependencies
✅ High Efficiency: Concurrent service initialization, proper error handling
✅ High Reliability: Comprehensive error handling, authentication checks
✅ Feature Flags: Integrated where applicable (subscription features, admin access)
✅ No Mock Implementation: All placeholder code replaced with real service calls

**RESULT:** All API endpoints now use production-ready implementations with real data sources, proper authentication, and comprehensive error handling. Zero mock/placeholder data remaining.
