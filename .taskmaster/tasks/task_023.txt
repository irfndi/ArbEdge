# Task ID: 23
# Title: Complete Legacy Code Elimination & Full Modularization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: critical
# Description: Eliminate all remaining legacy code, legacy adapters, and legacy system integration components. Move everything to the new unified modular architecture with zero legacy dependencies.
# Details:
This task ensures complete elimination of all legacy code and technical debt before production deployment. The goal is to have a completely clean, modern, modular architecture with zero legacy code remaining.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive code audit to verify zero legacy code remains, all tests pass, CI pipeline success, and production deployment validation

## 1. Audit and Remove All Legacy Modules [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and remove all legacy_* modules and files throughout the codebase
### Details:
Comprehensive audit of all legacy_* files and modules, remove them completely, and migrate any remaining functionality to new modular services

## 2. Eliminate Legacy Adapter Layers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove all legacy adapter layers and compatibility code
### Details:
Remove legacy adapter layers, compatibility shims, and bridge code that was used during migration phase

## 3. Migrate Legacy Functionality to Modular Services [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Move all remaining legacy functionality to new modular services
