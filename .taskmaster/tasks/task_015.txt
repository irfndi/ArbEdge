# Task ID: 15
# Title: D1/R2 Persistence Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design schema for both structured (D1) and blob (R2) data with connection pooling, retry logic, transaction support, and data migration utilities
# Details:
Implement database schema definitions, connection management service with pooling, transaction coordinator with rollback capabilities, and migration scripts for seamless data transitions.

# Test Strategy:
Database connections stable, transactions work with rollback, migrations execute successfully, performance targets met

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design comprehensive schema for both D1 (structured data) and R2 (blob storage) with data type mapping and relationships
### Details:
Create schema definitions for user data, market data, opportunities, sessions, and configuration. Define R2 blob storage strategy for large objects, files, and analytics data. Include data type mapping, relationships, indexes, and performance optimization.

## 2. Implement Connection Management Service [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create connection pooling and management service for both D1 and R2 with health monitoring and failover
### Details:
Implement connection pool manager with automatic connection health checks, retry logic, circuit breaker pattern, and failover strategies. Support both D1 database connections and R2 storage access with proper resource management and monitoring.

## 3. Build Transaction Coordinator [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Create transaction management system with rollback capabilities and distributed transaction support
### Details:
Implement transaction coordinator supporting ACID properties, distributed transactions across D1/R2, automatic rollback on failures, and transaction monitoring. Include transaction logging, deadlock detection, and recovery mechanisms.

## 4. Create Migration Utilities [done]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Develop database migration scripts and utilities for seamless schema changes and data transitions
### Details:
Build migration framework supporting schema versioning, forward/backward migrations, data transformation utilities, and zero-downtime deployments. Include migration validation, rollback capabilities, and automated migration execution.

## 5. Add Performance Optimization & Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Implement performance monitoring, query optimization, and database health metrics collection
### Details:
Create performance monitoring system with query analysis, slow query detection, connection pool metrics, and database health dashboards. Include query optimization recommendations, index usage analysis, and automated performance tuning.

## 6. Integration Testing & Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 15.5
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite validating database operations, transactions, and performance targets
### Details:
Build integration tests covering connection stability, transaction rollback scenarios, migration execution, performance benchmarks, and failure recovery. Include load testing, concurrent access validation, and end-to-end workflow testing.
