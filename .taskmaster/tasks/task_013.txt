# Task ID: 13
# Title: Fix Telegram Command Router
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the Telegram modular command system to properly route commands to sophisticated handlers instead of using basic implementations. Currently CommandRouter::route_command uses basic implementations instead of delegating to sophisticated handlers in profile.rs, opportunities.rs, admin.rs, etc.
# Details:
Fixed command router to delegate to proper modular handlers with production-ready responses, RBAC support, and proper error handling. All CI tests now pass with 468 tests.

# Test Strategy:
All CI tests pass, commands properly delegate to modular handlers
