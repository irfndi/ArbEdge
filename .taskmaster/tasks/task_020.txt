# Task ID: 20
# Title: Monitoring & Observability
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensive metrics for all data operations, real-time alerting for anomalies, performance monitoring and optimization, cost tracking for storage usage
# Details:
Build metrics collection system covering performance, reliability, capacity, and cost. Include real-time monitoring dashboard, alerting and notification system, and cost analysis tools for operational excellence.

# Test Strategy:
All metrics collected accurately, alerts fire appropriately, dashboard shows real-time data, cost tracking is precise

# Subtasks:
## 1. Metrics Collection Engine [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive metrics collection system using OpenTelemetry standards with support for RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) metrics, custom business metrics, and infrastructure monitoring
### Details:
Build production-grade metrics collection engine supporting multiple metric types (counters, gauges, histograms), OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, efficient aggregation, and real-time streaming to storage backends

## 2. Real-time Alerting System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Advanced alerting engine with anomaly detection, threshold-based alerts, multi-channel notifications, and intelligent alert routing with escalation policies
### Details:
Implement enterprise-grade alerting system with ML-based anomaly detection, customizable alert rules, noise reduction, correlation analysis, and integration with notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks)

## 3. Performance Monitoring Dashboard [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Interactive real-time dashboards for system performance monitoring with customizable views, drill-down capabilities, and executive-level reporting
### Details:
Build modern web-based dashboard system with real-time metrics visualization, customizable charts and graphs, SLI/SLO tracking, capacity planning views, and automated report generation for stakeholders

## 4. Cost Tracking & Analysis Engine [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive cost monitoring system for cloud resources, storage usage, compute costs, and financial optimization recommendations with budget alerts
### Details:
Develop FinOps-compliant cost tracking system with real-time cost monitoring, resource utilization analysis, cost allocation by service/team, budget management, and automated cost optimization recommendations
