# Task ID: 16
# Title: Circuit Breaker & Health Monitoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement circuit breakers for all external dependencies, real-time health monitoring for KV/D1/R2, alerting for service degradation, and automatic failover mechanisms
# Details:
Build circuit breaker implementation with configurable thresholds, health monitoring dashboard with real-time status, alert management system for proactive notifications, and failover automation for seamless service continuity.

# Test Strategy:
Circuit breakers trigger correctly, health monitoring shows accurate status, alerts fire appropriately, failover works automatically

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Circuit Breaker Framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive circuit breaker implementation with configurable thresholds, state management, and integration points for external dependencies
### Details:
Build the foundational circuit breaker framework with states (Closed, Open, Half-Open), configurable failure thresholds, timeout periods, and success criteria. Include metrics collection, state transition logging, and integration hooks for various dependency types (HTTP APIs, databases, KV stores).

## 2. Build Real-time Health Monitoring System [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive health monitoring for KV, D1, R2 storage systems with real-time status tracking and performance metrics
### Details:
Create health monitoring system that continuously checks KV store operations, D1 database connectivity and performance, R2 storage accessibility and throughput. Include health check endpoints, performance metrics collection, latency monitoring, and health status aggregation with dashboard-ready data structures.

## 3. Create Service Degradation Alerting System [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Build intelligent alerting system for detecting and notifying about service degradation with configurable thresholds and escalation paths
### Details:
Implement alerting system that detects service degradation patterns, triggers appropriate notifications, and manages alert escalation. Include configurable alert rules, multiple notification channels, alert deduplication, and integration with monitoring metrics. Support both real-time alerts and trend-based warnings.

## 4. Implement Automatic Failover Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Build automatic failover system for seamless service continuity during outages or degradation events
### Details:
Create automated failover mechanisms that detect service failures and automatically switch to backup systems or degraded modes. Include fallback strategies for KV/D1/R2 services, graceful degradation modes, automatic recovery detection, and failover coordination across distributed components.

## 5. Integration Testing & System Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite validating circuit breaker behavior, health monitoring accuracy, alerting functionality, and failover mechanisms
### Details:
Build integration tests that verify circuit breaker state transitions under various failure scenarios, health monitoring accuracy across all monitored services, alert generation and escalation workflows, and failover mechanism effectiveness. Include load testing, chaos engineering scenarios, and end-to-end validation.
