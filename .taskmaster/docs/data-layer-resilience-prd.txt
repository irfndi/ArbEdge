# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Data Layer Resilience

## Project Overview
Implement a fault-tolerant, multi-tier data access layer with KV caching, persistent storage (R2/D1), chaos engineering resilience, and automatic cleanup mechanisms for the ArbEdge platform.

## Executive Summary
The current data layer lacks comprehensive resilience mechanisms. We need to implement a robust multi-tier architecture that provides:
- Fast KV caching with automatic failover 
- Persistent storage with R2/D1 integration
- Chaos engineering fault tolerance
- Cloudflare pipeline integration
- Automatic synchronization and cleanup
- Backward compatibility with existing services

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Zero Data Loss**: 99.99% data persistence guarantee
2. **High Availability**: <50ms cache access, <200ms database access
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Service continues during component failures
4. **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic sync when services come back online
5. **Clean Operations**: Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Cache hit ratio: >95%
- Database failover time: <500ms
- Sync completion time: <5 seconds after service recovery
- Storage cleanup efficiency: >90% obsolete data removal
- System uptime: >99.9%

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Multi-Tier Data Access Layer
```
Application Layer
    ↓
Cache Layer (KV Store)
    ↓ (on miss/write-through)
Persistence Layer (D1/R2)
    ↓ (backup/archive)
Cold Storage (R2 Archive)
```

#### 2. Service Integration Points
- **KV Store**: Cloudflare Workers KV (primary cache)

4. **Automatic recovery** works without manual intervention
5. **Storage growth** controlled through effective cleanup
