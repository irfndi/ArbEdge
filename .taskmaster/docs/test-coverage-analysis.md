**Risk**: Market opportunities may not reach users, platform appears broken.

#### **3. Trading Focus Change Impact** ❌ **NO TESTS**
```
User Changes Focus → Preferences Update → Opportunity Filtering Changes → Different Notifications
```
**Services Involved**: UserTradingPreferences → OpportunityCategorizationService → Notifications (0%)

**Risk**: User preference changes may not take effect, wrong opportunity types delivered.

#### **4. AI Enhancement Pipeline** ❌ **NO TESTS**
```
Market Data → AI Analysis → Enhanced Opportunities → User-Specific Recommendations
```
**Services Involved**: Exchange (0%) → MarketAnalysis → AiIntelligence → OpportunityCategorizationService → Notifications (0%)

2. **Create mock Exchange API responses** - Set up test data for market scenarios
3. **Build first E2E test** - Complete user journey from registration to notification
4. **Set up test database environment** - Isolated test D1 + KV instances

#### **Week 2 Actions**
1. **Complete service integration tests** for all 0% coverage services
2. **Implement remaining E2E user journeys** 
3. **Add error scenario testing**
4. **Validate test coverage improvements**

#### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ **95%+ overall test coverage** (up from 14.05%)
- ✅ **All critical user journeys have E2E tests**
- ✅ **No services with 0% coverage in core business logic**
- ✅ **Integration between services validated**
- ✅ **Error scenarios tested and handled gracefully**

## 🚨 **Production Readiness Blockers**

### **Current Blockers**
1. **Data Persistence Untested** - D1Service has 0% coverage, risk of data loss
2. **Market Data Pipeline Untested** - ExchangeService has 0% coverage, risk of stale/missing data
3. **Core Business Logic Untested** - GlobalOpportunityService has 0% coverage, risk of broken opportunity distribution
4. **User Communication Untested** - NotificationService has 0% coverage, risk of silent failures
5. **No End-to-End Validation** - User journeys not tested, risk of broken user experience

### **Production Deployment Requirements**
- [ ] **40%+ test coverage minimum**
- [ ] **All critical services have integration tests**
- [ ] **Primary user journeys have E2E tests**
- [ ] **Error recovery scenarios tested**
- [ ] **Performance under realistic load validated**

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until at least Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing is complete. The current 14.05% coverage with 0% coverage on critical services presents unacceptable risk for production users.
