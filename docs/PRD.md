Version: 2.1
Date: May 23, 2025
Status: Enhanced - User-Centric Trading Platform with BYOK and AI Integration

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for an advanced automated cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. The system has evolved from a basic arbitrage detector to a sophisticated user-centric trading platform with hybrid opportunity sharing and AI-powered personalization. The primary goal is to identify, evaluate, and execute low-risk arbitrage opportunities with global shared opportunities while supporting BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) AI integration for personalized strategy development. Users can interact with AI to find opportunities based on their rules, interact with their exchange APIs, and execute auto/manual position opening with dynamic trade configuration based on available funds.

1.2 Product Vision

- **Global Opportunity Sharing**: Base opportunities available to all users with default system strategy
- **BYOK AI Integration**: Users can bring their own AI API keys to create personalized opportunity detection rules
- **Dynamic Fund-Based Trading**: Trade configuration dynamically adjusts based on user's available funds and AI interaction
- **Freemium Model**: Free tier with invitation codes, progressing to referral system, then subscription-based access
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Performance analytics across multiple time periods (1D, 7D, 14D, 30D, etc.)

All accessible through a secure Telegram interface running on Cloudflare's edge network.

1.3 Scope
